    <!-- We'll complete 1 and 2 together! -->

    <!-- 1. IDE Layout -->
    <!-- The left side contains the File Explorer where you can see your project files. -->
    <!-- The center area is the Code Editor where you'll write your code. -->
    <!-- The right side is the Console/Output where you'll see the results of your code execution. -->
    <!-- The top bar contains buttons for running your code, creating new files, and more. -->

    <!-- 2. Code Editing -->
    <!-- In the Code Editor, you can start writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. -->
    <!-- Try changing the text below to "Hello, Code Nation!": -->
    <p>Hello, World!</p>



    <!-- Go through steps 3-7 by yourself or with a partner. -->

    <!-- 3. Running Code -->
    <!-- To run your code, click the "Run" button in the top bar or use the "Ctrl + Enter" shortcut. -->
    <!-- The output will appear in the Console/Output section below your code. -->

    <!-- 4. Console -->
    <!-- Below is a script that runs JavaScript. -->
    <!-- Check out the console to see if this message is there! -->
    <!-- Find the wrench 🔧 icon and click that to see. -->
    <!-- Try changing the message! -->
    <script>
        console.log("Hello from the Console!");
    </script>

    <!-- 5. Creating Files -->
    <!-- In the File Explorer, you can create new files or delete existing ones. -->
    <!-- Right-click on the left side and select "New File" to create a new file. -->
    <!-- Name it new-file.html -->



    <!-- 6. Deleting Files -->
    <!-- Right-click on the delete-this.html file and select "Delete" to remove it. -->



    <!-- 7. Saving and Closing a Project -->
    <!-- Your project autosaves, but you can also manually save your changes by clicking the "Save" button in the top bar. -->
    <!-- To close your project, click the "Close" button in the top-left corner. -->
